# Encrypt you backups

Written in BASH, this script allows you to compress, encrypt & transfer your UNIX based system folders.

> It's worth noting that this script makes a fair amount of assumptions as to your target and source systems. Also, considering that certain binaries might not pre-exist on the system you execute this script on, I highly recommend ***thoroughly*** reading each step as there may be use-cases where this script might not perform as expected.

## How to run:

1. Navigate to the working directory where the script is located.
``` 
sh backup.sh
```
